            <h3>Hundred Islands</h3>
            <p>Believed to have come into existence around 2 million years ago, the Hundred Islands is a spectacle of a total of 123 islands and an additional island during low tide. It is the first national park in the Philippines, as declared by former President Manuel L. Quezon on January 14, 1940.</p>

            <h3>Depth Pool</h3>
            <p>locals coined the term “Death Pool” because it suited the site’s thrilling effect. The Death Pool is a natural pool or a lagoon located on the far right side of the beach. This natural pool and other rock formations on Cabongaoan Beach was formed by the incessant lapping of tidal waves against the shore through the centuries. </p>

            <h3>Cathedral of St Joseph the Patriarch</h3>
            <p>Regarded as the only church in the town of Aguilar, the St. Joseph the Patriarch Parish Church is quite noticeable with its pink exterior. Its original bells from 1886 still ring to this day with proper renovations and preservation. The church also handles the elementary and high schools surrounding it.</p>
